			<h2>My Favorite Sport</h2>
			<img src="basketball.png" width=600px>
			<p>Basketball is a thrilling and dynamic sport that captivates fans around the world. The game involves two teams of five players each, who strive to score points by shooting the ball through the opposing team's hoop. It requires a unique combination of physical prowess, skillful coordination, and strategic thinking. Basketball is renowned for its fast-paced action, with players dribbling, passing, and shooting in a relentless display of athleticism. The sport demands teamwork and communication, as players must work cohesively to outwit their opponents and execute intricate plays. From high-flying dunks to pinpoint three-point shots, basketball offers a spectacular display of individual talent and collective effort. With its rich history, iconic players, and global appeal, basketball has become more than just a gameâ€”it's a cultural phenomenon that continues to inspire and unite people of all ages and backgrounds. I love it because it provides pure entertainment while also giving the players exercise and stimulation.</p>
